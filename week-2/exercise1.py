# Exercise 1: Working with Variables
# Instructions: Follow the comments and complete the code.

# 1. Declare a variable 'name' and assign it your name as a string.
name = # Your code here

# 2. Declare a variable 'age' and assign it your age as an integer.
age = # Your code here

# 3. Print out the variables in the following format:
# "My name is <name> and I am <age> years old."
print("My name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old.")

# 4. Experiment: Change the values of 'name' and 'age' and run the code again.
