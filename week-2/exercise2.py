# Exercise 2: Math Operations
# Instructions: Perform basic operations with two numbers.

# 1. Declare two variables, 'num1' and 'num2', and assign them numbers.
num1 = # Your code here
num2 = # Your code here

# 2. Perform the following operations and print the results:
# Addition
addition = num1 + num2
print("Addition:", addition)

# Subtraction
subtraction = num1 - num2
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)

# Multiplication
multiplication = num1 * num2
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)

# Division
division = num1 / num2
print("Division:", division)

# Experiment: Try changing the values of 'num1' and 'num2' and rerun the code.
